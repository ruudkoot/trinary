Trinary Operating System Disk Image

This is the initial version of the Trinary Operating System, on SourceForge.net.
Although TrinaryOS is still in a pre-alpha state we still want you to see some
of it's very early features.

To create a boot disk under DOS or Windows simply run SETUP.BAT. Under
UNIX/Linux/BSD/Hurd you can use 'cp ./tmp/disk /dev/fd0' or a similar
command.
