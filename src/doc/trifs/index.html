		<H2>File System Layout</H2>

		<H3>The Allocation Structure</H3>
		<P>
			All the available space of the file system is dived up in fixed size
			bands. Comparable to HPFS's bands. The difference with Ext2's block
			groups or BSD FFS's cylinder groups is the fact that there are many
			more bands in the file system. Usualy one hundred to one thousand.
		</P>
		<P>
			The first block or blocks of each band are occupied by a copy of the
			critical data in the Super Block (non-critical data is only stored
			in the Super Block in band 0). The bitmap is store at the sector
			following the middle of the band. A band that would consist of 16
			blocks could have the following layout:
		</P>
		<P>
			<CENTER><IMG SRC="bands.gif"></CENTER>
		</P>
		<P>
			The Super Block is stored in every block, because it is extremely
			critical for the functioning of the file system. If the Super Block
			is stored only once and it would get damaged, it will be imposible
			to recovery the file system automaticaly and would require inside
			knowledge to be repaired manualy. Almost no space is wasted by this
			huge amount of redundancy.
		</P>
		<P>
			Storing the bitmap in the begin of the band, but after the
			Trasaction log gives the best performance. During the design of the
			file system two other alternative locatings for the bitmap were
			considerd. Stroring is in the middle, or splitting it in two and
			storing one in the beginning and one in the end. While storing the
			bitmap in the middle might decrease the average distance a random
			piece of data, extra seeks are required, of which most are backward.
			Due to the design of hard disk there seeks are much more costly than
			forward seeks. (Because the bands are very small a seek usualy
			doesn't required the heads to be moved, but simply involves waiting
			for the right sector to move under the head. Because the sectors are
			laid out sequentialy on the track. Higher sector number will be
			there	soon, but you have to wait a whole rotation before the lower
			sectors start appearing again.) A few long seeks are still faster
			than a lot of small seeks. Splitting the Bitmap would require extra
			seeks when actoins that need to use the Transaction Log are are
			performed. To overcome this a second Transaction Log would be
			necessary. In this case it more efficient to reduce the size of the
			bands. (For completeness it should also be noted that storing the
			bitmap at the end offers no benifits and might degrade performance
			because they are stored further form the data.)
		</P>
		<P>
			The Transaction Log is located before the Bitamp to increase speed,
			again by avoiding (backward) seeks. Most actions that require the
			Transaction Log add a log entry first and modify the Bitmap directly
			after.
		</P>

		<H3>The Super Block</H3>
		<P>
			
		</P>

		<H3>The Bitmap</H3>
		<P>
			The Bitmap is used to keep track of the blocks that are and are not
			allocated in the band it belongs to. The Bitmap is only used during
			the allocation of file system space. All blocks of the bands are
			included in this bitmap, including the Super Block and the Bitmap
			itself. Bit <I>x</I> of the bitmap correspondend to block <I>X</I>
			in the band. Note: this is a situation, where litle-endian
			(Intel-style) machines really pay off.
		</P>
		<P>
			The a bit in the bitmap can have on of the following meanings:
			<TABLE>
				<TR><TH>Value</TH><TH>Meaning</TH></TR>
				<TR><TD>0</TD><TD>The block is free and can be allocated.</TD></TR>
				<TR><TD>1</TD><TD>The block is already allocated, reserved or damaged.</TD></TR>
			</TABLE>
		</P>
		<P>
			Since the first block of the band is always used by the Super Block,
			the first bit of the Bitmap should always be set to 1. A value of 0
			here is reserved for the parallel file system extension.
		</P>
		<P>
			The Bitmap is a non-critical structure. If it would be destroyed it
			can be restruced (although this is a time consuming process).
			Therefore there is no backup copy. Keeping multiple versions
			synchronised would decrease the performance unnecesarily.
		</P>

		<H3>Directories</H3>
		<P>
			Directories are just stored as normal files. The only difference is
			that they have the D flag set in their node, which may also affect
			other flags in the node.
		</P>
		<P>
			The directory is dived into 32 byte entries. The first entry is the
			header and has following layout:
		</P>
		<P>
			<TABLE BORDER=1>
				<TR>

				<TR>
					<TD>Identifier</TD><TD></TD><TD>File Entry Start</TD><TD>Empty Entry Start</TD>
				</TR>
			</TABLE>
		</P>
		<P>
			The File Entry Starty entry points to the entry where the search
			for a file should be started. A File Entry has the following layout:
		</P>
		<P>
			<TABLE BORDER=1>
				<TR>
					<TH>unt64</TH><TH>unt64</TH><TH>unt64</TH><TH>unt64</TH>

		</P>
		<P>
			Hash contais the hashed file name (see Appendix ?). This helps
			speeding up directory searches by avoiding string compares.
		</P>
		<P>
			Block contains the block of the disk that contains the Node for the
			file.
		</P>
		<P>
			Left Leaf contains an entry that has a lower or equal Hash value and
			Right Leaf contains an entry that has a higher Hash value. The
			enties are linked together as a balanced tree. This solves the
			problem of most file systems that lose speed when using directories
			that contain a large number of files (100 000 - 1 000 000+).
			Opening a file could have taken seconds. Unsing a balanced tree
			reduces the maximum number of files to be compared to
			log2(<I>x</I>). Where <I>x</I> is the number of files in the
			directory. On average log2(<I>x</I> / 2) = log2(<I>x</I>) - 1 files
			need to be compared. In directory that contains 1 000 000 files only
			20 files need to be compared at maximum and 19 on average. An
			improvement of over 25 000 times.
		</P>
		<P>
			Note that is the directory becomes disbalanced no files are lost.
			Performace is degraded at most, but the hashing of the filenames
			usualy creates random values, meaning the degradation will be
			undeteactable in most cases. Disbalanced trees are not always
			detected and or repared by the file system driver. A disk
			diagnostics utility should be used for that. Bug free drivers should
			not create disbalanced trees even during sudden power failuers,
			because of the Transaction Log.
		</P>
		<P>
			Name contains the filename. It can span sereral entries and is
			terminated by a NULL character. There no restriction on the lenght.
			The filename is stored in ASCII and only charactes 0x20 through
			0x7E should be used. Characters 0x00 is the termination character.
			Charactes 0x01 through 0x01F and 0x7F are reserved. Character 0x80
			through 0xFF are reserved for the Unicode / UTF-8 extension.
		</P>

		<H2>Comparision</H2>
		<P>
			In this table TriFS is compared to the other major file systems around. AS far as I'm aware other
			file systems here are eiter standard UNIX file system, which are comparable (but often not as good
			as) Ext2 FS.
		</P>
		<P>
			Intel machines use the FAT 16, FAT 32, Ext2 FS, Ext3 FS, NTFS, ReiserFS, BeFS and HPFS file systems.
			Apples running MacOS 9 or lower use HFS FI they run MacOS X they use uses HFS+. SPARCs often run
			Solaris and therefore use EFS or XFS, but if they run Linux Ext2 FS is used. DEC Alpha's and MIPS
			usualy run a UNIX clone or Linux using the Ext2 FS file system, or somthing comparable. If they run
			Windows NT, NTFS is used. PowerPCs generaly run Linux using Ext2 FS or sometimes BeOS using BeFS.
