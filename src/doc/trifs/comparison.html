        <H3>NTFS</H3>
        <P>
            I´ll start of with NTFS (Microsoft´s New Technology File System)
            because it is, in my humble opinion, the most advanced file system
            designed, until this moment. It was designed in parallel with the
            Microsoft Windows NT 3.1 operating system, by a seperate design
            team. Internally it is layout as an transaction-based relational
            database. We'l now explore the many features of NTFS.

            <UL>
                <LI>
                    <B>Reliability</B> is achieved by several file system
                    structures. The most important one is the Transaction Log,
                    also known as the Journal. Journalling is quite a hot topic
                    in file system design, but NTFS had the ability as early as
                    1994. And more importantly NTFS's transaction really work,
                    in contradiction to some of the file systems that have the
                    capability of journalling added after it was designed. 
                </LI>
                <LI>
                    The <B>Master File Table (MFT)</B> is the heart of the NTFS
                    file system. The Master File Table allows the file system to
                    work like a database, but it is also a database on it's own.
                    It contains a record for each file, directory and metadata
                    structure on disk. Each record contains the location of the
                    attributes of a file and even some of the attributes
                    themselves if they are small enough.
                </LI>
                <LI>
                    Everything part of a file is stored as an <B>Attribute</B>.
                    Each file contains several Attributes like the Creation
                    Time, File Name and file's contents itself. The standard
                    contents are store in the Unnamed Attribute, but NTFS allows
                    multiple file streams using more attributes.
                </LI>
                <LI>
                    NTFS allows <B>Compression</B> on a file basis. It splits
                    files in 64 kB blocks so that files can be read and written
                    efficiently even after they have been compressed.
                    <I>
                        TriFS will use a different (or maybe even an user
                        selectable) compression algorithm. NTFS uses the
                        copyrighted LZW while TriFS will most likely use the
                        more advanced LZ77 algorithm. Next to that TriFS will
                        allow dynamically sized compression blocks, becuase 64
                        kB will be too small for future systems. Mabe the
                        blocksize can even differ within a file, to increase
                        compression, without loosing speed. Parts that don't
                        change can use large blocks, while parts that do can use
                        small blocks.
                    </I>
                </LI>
                <LI>
                    NTFS allows <B>Encryption</B> on a per file basis.
                    <I>
                        There's isn't much wrong with NTFS's encryption support,
                        but it is rather limited. It always uses the same 
                        encryption same encryption algorithms and will only
                        store keys for the users who compressed it and for the
                        recovery user (usually the administrator). TriFS will
                        allows you store multiple keys, so you can share
                        encrypted files among multiple users.

                <LI>
                    <B>Quotas</B> are now embedded inside the file system. This
                    increases speed and reliability.
                </LI>
                <LI>
                    <B>Reparse Points</B> are a really weak form of symbolic
                    links, they only support directories. I guess Microsoft
                    needs them for the Distributed File System, because I don't
                    se why else they would have made them so useless.
                </LI>
                <LI>
                    <B>Sparse Files</B> are files of which only the parts that
                    are used (non zero) are stored. Although it decreases the
                    space consumed by some files, it will cause files to become
                    fragmented more quickly. They are only used for log files
                    with a consumer at the beginning in the file and a producer
                    writing at the end
