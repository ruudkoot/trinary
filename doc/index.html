			The Trinary Operating System is a new operating system designed
			using the most modern and advanced technologies. The keywords here
			are stability, simplicity and flexibility. That this goal is
			achieved at the cost of speed and compatibility is acceptable.

		<P>
			My name is Rudy Koot. I live in Maarssen in the <A HREF="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/print/nl.html">Netherlands</A>. I'm 17 years old and still
			going to <A HREF="http://www.niftarlake.nl">high-school</A>. After that I plan to study Information Technology / Computer Science.
			In my free time I spend too much time programming and surfing on the Internet. Apart from that
			I'm very fond of cabaret, English humor and fantasy role playing.
		</P>
		<P>
			I you want to sent me a letter of praise, ask me something, talk to me, fan-mail me or anything else
			(this includes hate-mail, but excludes a mail-bomb) you can do so by e-mailing me at
			<A HREF="mailto:rudykoot@trinary.tk">rudykoot@trinary.tk</A>. But try to put the word 'Trinary' in the
			subject, so you don't get blocked out by my spam-filter.

			To help us enhancing this OS run the most current version of TriOS on as many
			computers (with a different hardware configuration) you have access to. If the
			OS reports "Uncertified Hardware Detected", please make a report with the information given
			about that hardware component, say if the hardware was correctly detected, and if not,
			how it should be detected. And finally mail this report to <A HREF="mailto:rudykoot@trinary.tk">rudykoot@trinary.tk</A>.

				<P>
					Started working on SMP support.
				</P>
				<LI><A HREF="os030308.zip">Trinary Operating System 03.03.02 (Alpha)</A></LI>
				<P>
					This version is been ported to GCC. Except for the Run Time Library most of the
					code is completly rewritten. Although it no longer has ATA support it does have
					better exception handling, which you hopefully don't see and multitasking, finaly.
				</P>
				<P>
					Each of the counter you see is a seperate task. You can notice that by the fact that
					they are noticably counting out of sync after about a minute. At the moment they are
					kernel tasks, meaning that they run at privilege level 0. This will change in the next
					release which will hopefully be out sooner than this version.
				</P>
				<P>
					Every 20 seconds or so the screen gets messed up and the Interrupt Counter in the title
					bar indicates that and IRQ7 has occured. This a problem with the interrupt controller
					and is called a Spurious IRQ7. A Surious IRQ7 occures when the Interrupt Controller
					can't handle the IRQs fast enough. The is caused by the Interval Timer which raises
					IRQ0 close to 100 000 times a second. As a comparrison: under DOS/Windows 3.1/Windows 9x
					IRQ0 is raised only 18.7 times a second and under Windows NT/2K/XP 1000 times a second.
					I's better slow it down somewhat in the next release.
				</P>
				<LI><A HREF="os030207.zip">Trinary Operating System 03.02.07 (Alpha)</A></LI>
				<P>
					Interrupt support was added as well as some basic ATA disk support. The title bar
					contains an interrupt counter. The model ofthe device connected to the master
					or slave of your primary IDE port is displayed.
				</P>
				<LI><A HREF="os030201.zip">Trinary Operating System 03.02.01 (Alpha)</A></LI>
				<P>
					The previous versions would only run on a Pentium II, Athlon or higher, because of a wrong
					compiler setting.
					This version work on a 386 and up. Corrected some errors in the CPU detection
					code. The light of the floppy drive is now turned off and the A20 is enabled.
					Some major work was done to the run-time library.
				</P>
				<LI><A HREF="os030128.zip">Trinary Operating System 03.01.28 (Alpha)</A></LI>
				<P>
					This version has paging enabled, and some basic memory
					management functions. The CPU detection also works
					correctly now. A small bug in the <CODE>strcmp</CODE> function caused
					it to fail on the Pentium II, Pentium III, Pentium 4 and AMD Athlons.
				</P>

				<LI><A HREF="os030127.zip">Trinary Operating System 03.01.27 (Alpha)</A></LI>
				<P>
					This version fixes the bugs in the previous ones.
				</P>

				<LI><A HREF="os030123.zip">Trinary Operating System 03.01.23 (Alpha)</A></LI>
				<P>
					TriOS can now identify your processor and will display it's
					name on the screen. Anything form a 486 to a Pentium 4 to a
					Cyrix MediaGX can be identified. Due to the simplicity of
					the current bootloader, the kernel isn't loaded completely
					in memory, and some of the text displayed will be messed up.
				</P>

				<LI><A HREF="os030120.zip">Trinary Operating System 03.01.20 (Alpha)</A></LI>
				<P>
					This is the first public release of the Trinary Operating
					System. It has a basic bootloader and kernel. Due to a
					small bug, it will only load under an emulator, an won't
					load on a real computer.

					This archive contains a minimal DOS port of GCC 2.96 (DJGPP 2.03 with Binutils 2.9), NASM 0.98 and the
					Bochs emulator (2.0.pre3). If you want to build TriOS under any other OS just use the GCC that
					comes with your OS and look at the <CODE>build.bat</CODE> file to see how to build
					what files. You'll have to be original with the files that need to be assembled with NASM
					(extract them from the disk image for example). I'll port them to GAS soon.

				<LI><A HREF="dt030201.zip">Development Tools for Trinary Operating System 03.02.01 - 03.02.07</A></LI>
				<P>
					This archive only includes NASM and the Visual Studio workspace. You still

				<P>
					This archive contains some of the tools needed to build the
					kernel and a disk image. These include NASM, TCC and some
					scripts. You will also need Microsoft Visual C++ to build
					most of the C files, however. Alternatively you could try
					<A HREF="msdn.microsoft.com">Microsoft Visual C.NET</A> or
					the <A HREF="developer.intel.com">Intel Optimizing C++ Compiler</A>.

			The ultimate goal of the Trinary Operating System is to make it world's leading OS. To achieve this goal
			we will need your support, however. So how do you support us? Well, it's very easy. Add a link to
			<A HREF="http://www.trinary.tk">http://www.trinary.tk</A> on your homepage. If you want some more
			decoration, you can use an <A HREF="#downloadlogos">image</A>. Once you done that, you can mail me at
			<A HREF="mailto:rudykoot@trinary.tk">rudykoot@trinary.tk</A>. I will then add a link to your site on this
			page.
