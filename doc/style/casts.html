			I know that that you must have heard this thounsands of times, but it is so
			important: COMMENT A LOT! I have to repeat this, because every programmer
			knows this rule, but no one does it. Just look at Linux' source. They are
			just too under commented. A good measure ment it the code to comment ratio.
			It is good to have at least as much comments as code. I usualy have even
			more comments that code, so it shouln't be too hard. Also start commenting
			before you code and while you code. Don't do it afterwards, because you
			wont. It is also a good idea to write things you want to down inside your
			comments so you don't worget it, or somebody else can do it. But if you do
			that make sure you say that you are going to implement it to avoid anyone,
			including yourself, thinking it is already implemented.
